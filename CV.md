Technical Skills
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **Python:** Self-taught Python, have also had some experience with projects on GitHub

:   **STATA/R/MATLAB:** Have used all in a university setting, currently using STATA for my honours thesis      and have done some RA work in R and MATLAB
